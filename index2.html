		<p><span class="tab">She</span> is Shia Sheridan. She has no dream. She does not know what she wants. She has no plans for her life. But because of being accused with a mistake that she did not do, she was forced to go into the place she hated the most, which is the Titan Academy of Special Abilities. It is a school wherein people like her with special abilities would fit in. A school for Elites and never for an outcast and poor like her. </p>
			<p>Welcome to Titan Academy! Because it takes more than power to be special. </p>
